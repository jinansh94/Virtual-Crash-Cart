# Virtual-Crash-Cart
OUR MISSION
Our mission is to build an immersive virtual learning environment for medical professionals to remember the locations of life saving equipment/medicines in a crash cart.

What is a crash cart?

A crash cart is a cart that is kept in an Operation Theatre with all the medical equipments that are required during any emergency procedure.

To ensure availability of all the equipments at the time of an operation, Crash carts are locked. Once unlocked, they need to go through a strict confirmation process to qualify as a emergency ready crash cart.

 

 

Motivation for this project?

Since the professionals need to access the medical equipment inside the cart frequently to remember the location and respond efficiently at the time of an emergency, they need to train better.

Access to the crash cart is limited as it is a big affair in monetary terms to unlock and train on a real crash cart.

Researchers estimated that more than 250,000 Americans die each year from treatment-related mistakes, making a medical error the third-leading cause of death in the United States

This project aims at better training of the professionals on a virtual crash cart that mimics the real one. This saves a lot of money and helps the individuals keep track of their performance.

 

What have we made?

and learn from his mistakes.analyseWe have also provided time taken to pass each object, as well as the attempt number of the player.This would help the user

The questions are in the form of text as well as audio and the questions automatically depend on the items placed in the crash cart. The number of questions is controllable using a simple text box inside Unity. When the quiz gets over, user is shown his total time taken. He can keep track of the time and keep aiming for better timings.

The project involves individuals training on a virtual crash cart in a hospital setting. They are quizzed on the locations of various items in the cart and they have to pass the item to the medical professional standing by quickly and correctly.

The project first teaches the basics of using Oculus rift controllers to the user in our environment. This is done in an interactive tutorial. He is taught grabbing, releasing, turning and moving around in the tutorial setting.

We have built an immersive virtual reality learning environment for medical professionals to remember the locations of life saving equipment and medicines in a crash cart.
